Examples of web projects built by me to showcase my skills.

<h1>Music Player</h1>

<p>This is a music player made with HTML, CSS and JS. It features a music player that can play, pause and adjust the time of the song anywhere on the progress bar. Javascript allows the progress bar to advance with the song every half second and the play/pause button will adjust accordingly.
